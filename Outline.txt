- Intro

--> Machine Learning: Definition, Examples
--> Supervised Learning: When you know the result - Eg.
--> Unsupervised Learning: When you don't know the result - Eg.

A walkthrough to solving an ML problem - ML101 (Housing prices; tweak it to meetup spaces)

- Deflating the hype

--> IMHO, here instead of TEACHING everything, the focus should be on showing them how basic ML requires basic math and the fact that they can pick up skills on the go.

How?? --> Introduce bare bones LA, PS, Calculus to them as required by the algo under consideration.

Caveat: It will be necessary to emphasize that all of the math in ML should not be done this way and it is good to build up a solid foundation in mathematics before you delve deep in ML/DL

Linear Regression:

- Show a problem with continuous variable
- Give an intuitive sense of a cose function
- Introduce gradient descent
- Normal Equation (derive??)
